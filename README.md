# Joycell-Challenge-3

## Description

<br>This is the third challenge assignment of the Coding Bootcamp. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I was able to </br>
<br>create a password generator that allows users to choose the length and type of characters to use. Using randomization, </br>
<br>it will help users easily maintain their account security by maintaining a new and secure password.</br>

## Installation

<br>Right click on index.html</br>
<br>Select "Open In Default Browser"</br>
<br>Once it populates, you are free to create your very own password.</br>
<br>You can also to go the DevTools section and check the console.log action.</br>

## Usage

<br>This code can be used for ideas on how to create a password generator, but if there are any suggestions, feel free to let me know.</br>
